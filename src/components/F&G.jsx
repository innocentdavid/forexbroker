                            <li className=' py-1 md:py-2'>2. <b>Confirm the broker’s public profile:</b> Look up the entity name (i.e. the legal company or brand name) on the regulator's website to validate the registration number.</li>

                            <li className=' py-1 md:py-2'>4. <b>Global availability:</b> Confirm that the broker can accept clients in your country of residence. If the broker lacks regulation in your home country, it’s still worth checking to see if they can legally accept clients from your country (for example, if the broker is regulated in an alternate jurisdiction that is deemed acceptable).</li>

                            <li className=' py-1 md:py-2'>5. <b>Verification:</b> Call the phone number or contact the email address listed on the regulators’ website if you have any doubts as to the legitimacy of a website or brand purporting to be regulated.</li>
